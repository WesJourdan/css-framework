# css-framework
This is my attempt at creating a css framework. The point of this exercise is to learn how frameworks are built so that I can effectively use and modify existing frameworks.

This framework mimics bootstraps 12 column grid layout.

This framework has a "navbar" class that creates a fixed top navigation bar.
